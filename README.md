# Project Euler: First 100 Problems
Contains helpful solution developments for the first 100 problems of Project Euler.

## What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems.
Click [here](https://projecteuler.net/) to learn more information.

## What is the purpose?
I undertook this challenge as a fun way to advance my math and algorithmic-thinking skills.

## Why just the first 100 problems?
One of the rules of Project Euler explains that solution developments for only the first 100 problems can be publicly shared.
Any solutions that I find outside of the first 100 problems will be kept in a private repository.

## Project Status
_In progress_
